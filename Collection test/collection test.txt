2)Explain diffrence between List and Set with example?  
   LIST                                                    SET

1) List is an Ordered Sequence.                       1) Set is an Unordered Sequence.

2)List Allows Duplicates Elements.                    2) Set Does not allow duplicate Elements.
                     
3)Elements by their position can be accssed.          3) Position Access to elements is not allowed.

4)Multiple Null Elements can be stored.               4) Null elements can be stored once.

5)List Implements ArrayList,LinkedList.               5) Set implements HashSet,LinkedHashSet.

EX : List<String> list=new ArrayList<String>();			EX : Set<String> set=new Hashset<String>();
	list.add("suhas") ;							set.add("Shweta");


3) Difference between Iterator and ListIterator


          Iterator                                                        ListIterator

1) Iterator can traverse elements present in                       1) Can Traverse elements in both direction.
collection only in forward direction.
                                                                   2) ListIterator can obtain indexes of elements at anytime while transversing List.
2) Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.
                                                                   3) We can modify or replace elements with of set.
3) Cannot modify or replace elements present in collection.
                                                                   4) we can add elements to a collection at any time.
4) Iterator as methods of next(),remove(),hasNext().



7)Explain Linked List?
--Linked List
--Linked list is provides constant time for add and remove operation so it is better to use LL for manipulation.
--Linked list has 0(n/2)time complexity to access the element.
---LinkedList good for writing
---LinkedList is better to manipulate data
---Internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements
---It act as list and queces both because it implents list abd Deque interface
---Better for manipulting
---It is not contiguous
---Faster because it uses double linked list
